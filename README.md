# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project was done primarly to improve my own understanding regarding Linear Regression, and more precisely Gradient Descent algorithm. Therefore, the main objective was not to build a good regression model. 

The data used in this project, available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction), contains information on houses sold between 2014 and 2015 in King County, US.

The data was explored for [preprocessing](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Linear_Regression_from_Scratch/blob/main/Preprocessing.ipynb), and then all transformations were built into a [preprocessing-pipeline](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Linear_Regression_from_Scratch/blob/main/Preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb) were different configurations were tested. Finally, several models were [built](https://github.com/pcmaldonado/Linear_Regression_from_Scratch/blob/main/Linear_regression_from_scratch.ipynb) from scratch in order to study Linear Regression and how the Normal Equation and Gradient Descent work.

All of these steps were made in Python (version 3.8.10), using JupyterNotebooks.
